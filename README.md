# AzureFunctions
Experimenting with Azure functions


# HttpTrigger
- [Python file handler](HttpTrigger/FileHandler) (Recieving files, do some stuff with them and sending them back to the caller) 
- [Python file handler using a template](HttpTrigger/FileHandlerWithTemplate) (Recieves a file, process it, filling the information into a template, which is saved in the same folder like the Azure function and sending it back as the result)
